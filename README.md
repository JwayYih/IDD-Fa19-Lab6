# ChatBot

*A lab report by Johnway Yih*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

Created a bot that introduced themselves to a user and learned a bit about them.  It would then ask them to join them for a climbing session and loop until the person complied. Some modifications include changing calculation to compare user age vs bot age. Looping until the person complied with either a yes or a maybe.


## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
